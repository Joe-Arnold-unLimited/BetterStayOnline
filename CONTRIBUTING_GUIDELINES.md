To create a support ticket or submit a feature request, please go to Issues above and create a ticket. I promise I will see them and get to them quickly. 

Remember that this is a free time project, I am currently only looking at the code at the weekends, but I will respond to tickets during the week. Please be respectful of that.

NO DISRESPECTFUL LANGUAGE OR DISCORSE DIRECTED AT ANYONE, BE IT A DEVELOPER OR A USER. YOU WILL GET BANNED!!!

At first, I am looking for suggestions on where to go from here. The project needs more settings and to be more useful for specific cases. Currently I am only testing this on my own machine and my broadband is pretty average/normal, people with more specific cases might need more tools I hadn't thought of. For example, those who use mobile 4G and 5G routers where latency can be a big issue. 

Anyone who wants to contribute code that would be very welcomed, but please let me know before you spend loads of time doing so. I just want to make sure our paths are aligned, which is making a great tool for anyone of no expertise to use to help them measure their internet and get a better deal from their ISP.

Make sure to get in touch if you've found this tool helpful guys and good luck!
