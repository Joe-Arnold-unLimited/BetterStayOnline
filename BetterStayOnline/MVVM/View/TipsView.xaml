Most routers have some sort of restart schedule, maybe every couple weeks. "

Tech support is there to assist you and yes they do keep notes on your account of the discussions you have with them, but when dealing with a fault you will quite often speak to many different people, all who will say different things. If someone says you will get your money back for the time your service was down, RECORD IT. Which brings me onto the next point.&#x0a;&#x0a;  * RECORD YOUR PHONE CALLS WITH TECH SUPPORT. If you live somewhere it is legal to record your phone calls without the other party's permmission, do it. There are apps to do it for you. You don't want to be speaking to someone who offers a fix or compensation, then be passed to someone else who has no knowledge of what you're talking about.&#x0a;&#x0a;  * EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM TO ANY ENGINEERS YOU HAVE CONTACT WITH. It is all too easy for an engineer to come out, do a first line check on your line and say there is no problem. Do another speedtest, show them that there clearly is still a problem and convince them to do the next measure while they are still there. You don't want to let them leave, wait a week for the ISP to check up on you, tell them that it didn't help only to have to wait yet another week for another engineer. Also, the engineers do different jobs. The first time one comes out you might be told they are a low level or first line engineer only, and that they only do the standard check and nothing more complicated. Later they may send a higher level engineer only for the same person to turn up. So ask when they're there if they can help in any other way.&#x0a;&#x0a;  * BE NICE. Yes it is annoying spending so much time on the phone, and yes the hold music is infuriating, but the person on the other end is at least trying to help. If you annoy them, they can quite easily tell you they are putting you through to a manager, then just stick you back on hold and put you to the back of the queue for another operator. All because they didn't want to deal with you. A lot of people are working from home now too, and if you scream at someone who is in their living room heating up their lunch, they might just want to get rid of you. This also leads onto the next point.&#x0a;&#x0a;  * SPEAK TO SOMEONE IN THE OFFICE. Tech support often don't have all the questions. If you get through to someone who is working from home, that means they don't have immediate access to their colleagues who may be able to answer questions they can't. You can politely ask if you can speak to someone in an office and often you will be passed on.&#x0a;&#x0a;  * KEEP A LOG OF HOW LONG YOU SPEND ON THE PHONE. If you have a fault that goes on for a long time, it might be worth some compensation. It will help your case if you can say exactly how long you have spent on the phone trying to get this fixed. You can also point out how much time of that is spent on hold too."
